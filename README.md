# ErasureDecoder_InfoTheory
This repository contains the source codes to reproduce the Information theory related results of the paper "Undetected Error Probability in the Short Blocklength Regime: Approaching Finite-Blocklength Bounds with Polar Codes"

The paper is submitted for a review to "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS"

Codes are tested in MATLAB 2024b. If you would like to contribute please contact kislal@chalmers.se.
