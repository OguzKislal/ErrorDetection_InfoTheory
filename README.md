# ErasureDecoder_InfoTheory

This repository contains the source codes to reproduce the information-theoretic bounds reported in the paper "Undetected Error Probability in the Short Blocklength Regime: Approaching Finite-Blocklength Bounds with Polar Codes"

The paper is currently under review.

The code has been tested on MATLAB 2024b.
Additional information on how the bounds are computed is available [here](https://github.com/OguzKislal/ErrorDetection_InfoTheory/blob/main/SPApprox_ImplementationDoc.pdf).
